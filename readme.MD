**ProcessSpoofer** is not dangerous and cannot harm your system. As a cybersecurity specialist, I take security and privacy very seriously. There are placeholders implemented to prevent malicious use of the spoofer.
While some antivirus software may flag Spoofer as malicious (as they should, for it literally hides processes and is a very powerful tool), Spoofer presents absolutely no danger to your system.
